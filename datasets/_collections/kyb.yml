  Reference data, company registries and beneficial ownership databases used as inputs for
  data enrichment.
description: |
  This collection contains various large reference datasets, including company registries, beneficial ownership databases,
  and industry or domain specific databases. These data sources are used as a basis for
  [data enrichment](https://www.opensanctions.org/docs/enrichment/), a process designed to pick out risk-linked entities
  and their linked network from reference data sources to bring more detail to the main database.

  The data exports listed here contain the complete datasets, but only [a small fraction of each](https://www.opensanctions.org/datasets/enrichers/#sources)
  (the part that is identifiably linked to a sanctioned or otherwise notable entity) is eventually included in
  the [main OpenSanctions product](https://www.opensanctions.org/datasets/default/).

  Some of the included data categories include:

  - Company registries from various jurisdictions.
  - Beneficial ownership databases for a small set of countries where those are open data.
  - Reference data on LEIs (Legal Entity Identifiers), research organisations.
  - Port state control data from various international reporting mechanisms.
  - Banking reference data from the IRS, FinCEN and ISO 9362 (BIC).
  - ICIJ's Offshore Leaks databases.

  While the use of these data sources is covered by the [data license](https://www.opensanctions.org/licensing/), 
  a much reduced degree of manual data cleaning is performed on reference datasets. The **datasets are not deduplicated**.
  This means that if a source registry publishes multiple records that describe a single person or company, they will
  be reproduced in this data as-is.

  Most reference datasets are **updated once a week**. This doesn't apply to data sources which - by their nature - do not
  change on a regular basis (e.g. the ICIJ OffshoreLeaks database).

  This collection is also the basis for [OpenScreening](https://resources.linkurious.com/openscreening), a proof of 
  concept graph service released by Linkurious, Open Ownership and OpenSanctions in 2022.
