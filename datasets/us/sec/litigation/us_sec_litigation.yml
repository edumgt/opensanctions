description: >
  This dataset contains entities who are or have been subject to civil actions
  by the SEC. It includes the names of defendants, a high level indication of the
  status of the action, and links to more information by the SEC.

  > The SEC's civil law enforcement authority enables the Commission to hold
  > violators of the federal securities laws accountable for their misconduct
  > and recover money for the benefit of harmed investors.
  >
  > While SEC investigations into possible securities law violations by firms
  > or individuals are conducted privately to ensure they remain fair and
  > objective, the SEC takes action publicly when it finds evidence of
  > wrongdoing. Many violators agree to settlements that are announced once
  > their cases are made public, but other cases are litigated in federal
  > court or through an administrative proceeding and decided by a judge or
  > jury.
