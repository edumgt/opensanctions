  This dataset lists the members of the Swiss Federal Assembly.

  The data is collected from the open data web services provided by the
  Parliamentary Services of the Federal Assembly. The Federal Assembly is the
  bicameral parliament of Switzerland, consisting of two chambers:

  The **National Council** (Nationalrat/Conseil national/Consiglio nazionale)
  is the lower chamber with 200 members elected by proportional representation
  for four-year terms. Seats are distributed among the 26 cantons based on
  population.

  The **Council of States** (Ständerat/Conseil des États/Consiglio degli Stati)
  is the upper chamber with 46 members representing the cantons (two per canton,
  one per half-canton). Members are elected by their respective cantons for
  four-year terms.

  The Federal Assembly exercises legislative power, approves the federal budget,
  elects the Federal Council (executive branch), and oversees the administration.
  Both chambers have equal powers in legislation.
