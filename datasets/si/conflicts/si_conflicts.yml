  Under Slovenia’s Integrity and Prevention of Corruption Act (IPCA), public-sector bodies and 
  organizations are prohibited from doing business with entities where an official from that body, 
  or their family member, is a manager, legal representative, or holds 5% or more of the shares. 
  This dataset lists such entities. The restrictions aim to protect public funds by preventing 
  transactions that could cause a conflict of interest.
