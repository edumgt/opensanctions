  Current Members of the Canadian lower chamber, the House of Commons
description: |
  The members list is collected from the open data platform provided by the
  House of Commons of Canada. The House of Commons is the lower chamber
  of Canada's bicameral Parliament, alongside the Senate.

  The House of Commons consists of 338 members, each representing a
  single electoral district (also known as a riding or constituency).
  Members of Parliament (MPs) are elected by plurality in their districts,
  typically for a term of up to four years, though elections may be called
  earlier. Electoral boundaries are reviewed and adjusted following each
  decennial census to reflect population changes.

  The House of Commons is responsible for introducing and passing legislation,
  holding the government accountable through Question Period and committee work,
  and representing the interests of Canadians. The Prime Minister and most
  Cabinet ministers are typically members of the House of Commons.
