  Australia's list of terrorist organisations as listed under the Criminal Code Act 1995
description: |
  Under Australia's Criminal Code Act 1995, the Attorney-General may list an organisation as a terrorist organisation if they are satisfied on reasonable grounds that the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act.

  There are two ways in which an organisation is identified as a terrorist organisation:

  1. By being specified by name in the regulations (a listed terrorist organisation); or
  2. By being an organisation that is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act whether or not the terrorist act occurs (an unlisted terrorist organisation).

  As of recent legislative changes, regulations listing terrorist organisations continue indefinitely, rather than ceasing to have effect after three years.
