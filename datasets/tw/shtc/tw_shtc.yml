description: |
  This dataset lists entities designated by Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA).
  The entities are subject to restrictions due to concerns that the end-use or end-users may 
  be linked to the development or production of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), including 
  nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons, or related military applications. While the framework 
  focuses on strategic and high-tech commodities, not all entities on the list are necessarily 
  involved in high-tech industries.
